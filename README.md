# My Portfolio🔥

Hi, I’m Sienna Li! 👋

I'm a current student at UC Berkeley Extension School. I am an avid Web Develepment learner as I am fascinated by all the things web can do. I find myself regularly trying to learn new algorithms and techniques that I can implement in my projects. I also enjoy doing side projects from time to time to apply what I have learned into something useful. HTML was the language I started programming with, but soon after, I've been using CSS a lot more.Recently, I've been trying to learn new languages including JavaScript.
